    "Numpy introduction\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The NumPy package (read as NUMerical PYthon) provides access to\n",
    "\n",
    "-   a new data structure called `array`s which allow\n",
    "\n",
    "-   efficient vector and matrix operations. It also provides\n",
    "\n",
    "-   a number of linear algebra operations (such as solving of systems of linear equations, computation of Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues).\n",
    "\n",
    "### History\n",
    "\n",
    "Some background information: There are two other implementations that provide nearly the same functionality as NumPy. These are called “Numeric” and “numarray”:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Numeric was the first provision of a set of numerical methods (similar to Matlab) for Python. It evolved from a PhD project.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Numarray is a re-implementation of Numeric with certain improvements (but for our purposes both Numeric and Numarray behave virtually identical).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Early in 2006 it was decided to merge the best aspects of Numeric and Numarray into the Scientific Python (<span>`scipy`</span>) package and to provide (a hopefully “final”) `array` data type under the module name “NumPy”.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use in the following materials the “NumPy” package as provided by (new) SciPy. If for some reason this doesn’t work for you, chances are that your SciPy is too old. In that case, you will find that either “Numeric” or “numarray” is installed and should provide nearly the same capabilities.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a new data type (provided by NumPy) which is called “`array`”. An array *appears* to be very similar to a list but an array can keep only elements of the same type (whereas a list can mix different kinds of objects). This means arrays are more efficient to store (because we don’t need to store the type for every element). It also makes arrays the data structure of choice for numerical calculations where we often deal with vectors and matricies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors and matrices (and matrices with more than two indices) are all called “arrays” in NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vectors (1d-arrays)\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure we will need most often is a vector. Here are a few examples of how we can generate one:"

    "Recently there have been various attempts to address this weakness: well-known examples are the [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) project, a just-in-time compiled implementation of Python; the [Cython](http://cython.org) project, which converts Python code to compilable C code; and the [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) project, which converts snippets of Python code to fast LLVM bytecode.\n",
